Decap cms is installed.
Navigate to /admin/#/ and login to test.

# Test locally
To run this locally run:

1. npm run build
2. npm run preview

# Thoughts
Yeah I do not think I will use a git based cms.
Github requires a server for authentication...
Which destroys the whole point of using this kind of cms...
Netlify provides such a Server but I want to avoid dependencies.
And I need to grant to it access to ALL my public repos for some reason.
